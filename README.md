Dataset used in the [CHI 2021](https://chi2021.acm.org/) Student Research Competition Submission ["CopyCat: Using Sign Language Recognition to Help Deaf Children Acquire Language Skills"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411763.3451523).
This dataset contains **AlphaPose**, **Kinect**, and **Mediapipe** features extracted from 3914 4K RGB+D videos of ASL phrases and is intended for use by the interactive game CopyCat. In total, 8 users (novice adult ASL signers) are included and can be identified as p1 ... p8. In addition, 58 phrases ranging from 3 to 5 words in length were recorded at least 6 times for each user.
All data is of the form `MM-DD-YY_p(user id)_4KDepth/(phrase)/(instance of phrase)/MM-DD-YY_p(user_id)_4K.(phrase).(instance of phrase).(file extension)`
